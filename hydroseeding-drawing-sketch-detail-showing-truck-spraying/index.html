<p>Hydroseeding is an efficient technique used to cost-effectively revegetate large areas that include steep slopes delivering lower prices per hectare than other techniques. Some will put the hose over their shoulder which is a very comfortable way to hydroseed. Spraying somewhere close to horizontal will give you the best build up of a mulch layer compared to other techniques. Hydroseeding is the hydraulic application of water seed fertiliser and the option of growth supporting additives utilising purpose built hydroseeder trucks. The first tank was applied using the turret gun with a direct spray nozzle and the other 2 tanks I used the turret gun with a fan nozzle. Grizzly Grass Hydroseeding Home Facebook.</p>
