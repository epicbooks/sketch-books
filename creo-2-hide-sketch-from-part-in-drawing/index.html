<p>Trying to HideBlank Sketch Lines on Drawing Creo Parametric 30 I am creating an assembly and drawing of a final product and am encountering an issue where some sketches created in a part are showing. Hiding Sketches in Drawing Views I was wondering if there was a way to show a model sketch in a particular view but hide it in the others. These sketches were not absorbed into the features they were created for and are still showing all the way to the drawing. Hopefully the content of the post what we write you can understand. Ive been creating sketches in my models to later show bolt circles gage points etc in my detail drawings. Nyannai It S Been Awhile Since I Ve Drawn Jin So Why Not Worldwide Handsome Bts Drawings Art Sketches.</p>
